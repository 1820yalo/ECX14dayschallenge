# Pascal's Triangle Generator

## Overview

This project contains a function that generates Pascal's Triangle up to a specified number of rows. Pascal's Triangle is a triangular array of binomial coefficients. Each row represents the coefficients of the binomial expansion up to that row's number.

## Features

- Generates Pascal's Triangle up to `n` rows.
- Returns the triangle as an array of arrays.

## Installation

There's no installation required for this project. Simply download the script and include it in your Python environment.

## Usage

To use the Pascal's Triangle Generator, call the `generate_pascals_triangle` function with an integer argument representing the number of rows you wish to generate.

Example:
```python
from pascals_triangle_generator import generate_pascals_triangle

triangle = generate_pascals_triangle(5)
print(triangle)
# Output: [[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [1, 3, 3, 1], [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]]
```

## Parameters

- `n` (int): The number of rows for Pascal's Triangle. Should be a non-negative integer.

## Returns

- list: A list of lists, where each inner list represents a row of Pascal's Triangle.

## Approach and Logic

The function starts by initializing the triangle with the first row `[1]`. Each subsequent row is generated by:
1. Starting and ending with a `1`.
2. Calculating the middle values by summing two adjacent values from the previous row.
